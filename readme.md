# StronglyTypedId Example Project

This project is a .NET 9.0 web application that demonstrates the use of strongly-typed IDs with the [StronglyTypedId](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId) library. It uses Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL for data access and includes entities `Owner` and `Pet`, each with a strongly-typed ID. The application provides API endpoints to manage these entities.
